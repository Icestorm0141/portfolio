<h2 class="headline">Senior Capstone Design Advising</h2>
<p class="content">In
  order to adequately internalize the engineering design process
  while understanding the importance of effective team work in a
  multi-disciplinary context, engineering students (BS) at both RIT
  and USMA immerse themselves within a lengthy multidisciplinary
  team-based design experience as a culmination of their
  undergraduate programs. Therefore since 1998, I have had the
  opportunity to mentor fourteen multi-disciplinary teams throughout
  this experience. In order to provide the necessary mentoring for
  these individuals, I meet with the entire team once per week and
  with team leaders more frequently as required. By design, the
  projects often fall within my areas of strong interest from a
  technical and educational research perspective, such as within
  advanced thermodynamics; energy demand and supply strategies;
  educational training aides for use in classroom settings; and
  experimental set-ups involving energy-related apparatus. These
  areas are of interest to undergraduate students as well. </p>

<p class="content">Due
  to the high levels of achievement of past capstone design students
  which is augmented by the framework that I create during the
  capstone experience, several students have authored (or
  co-authored) technical papers based on their work. The following
  table includes a listing of the capstone design projects, my role
  on the team, academic term and university information, as well as
  the resulting publication (BS student names in bold). Whenever
  possible, the conference paper is presented by one or more of the
  BS students at the technical meeting.</p>
