<h1 class="smallHeadline">A
  Systems Approach to Matching Energy Demand of Complex, Energy
  Intensive Systems with Supply/Management Strategies<br />(2001
  &ndash; current)</h1>
<p class="content">The
  objective of this research is to investigate and analyze the
  methods by which power can be sustained and managed to meet the
  energy requirements of various applications. This research is
  focused on gaining a clear and thorough understanding of the
  overall power requirements for the specific application. During my
  time at West Point, a team of cadets and I studied the US Army&rsquo;s
  Land Warrior system which includes a complex array of components
  worn by the infantry soldier. Many of the soldier&rsquo;s
  components require electrical energy and our goal was to better
  match the variable levels of energy demand with various
  supply/management strategies. To gain this insight for the Land
  Warrior system, a survey was developed and distributed to infantry
  officers to better understand customer requirements related to
  power. In addition, a thorough analysis was conducted on an
  existing power requirement simulation associated with a 12-hour
  deliberate attack mission. Using the results of this data as well
  as expert interviews, detailed engineering specifications were
  developed which documented energy demand requirements of the
  system. Through the process of understanding this problem, it
  became evident that the soldier&rsquo;s mission specific power
  requirements were not well understood. Therefore, considerable
  effort was made to investigate the relationship between soldier
  power requirements and mission type and results showed an increase
  in power requirements of up to 15% depending on mission type. In
  addition to power demand, the issues of power/energy source and
  power management are also studied.  </p>
<p class="content">My
  interest in this area is still strong, however after joining the
  faculty at RIT I was unable to continue the activity described
  above due to logistical reasons. However, I have been approached
  by several students over the past two years at RIT who have
  expressed a desire to work with me on issues related to energy use
  within military applications. I have recently agreed to work with
  a student on an independent study titled, &ldquo;The Viability of
  Opposed-Piston Opposed-Cylinder Engines for Military Applications
  &ldquo; and will explore the feasibility of conducting this work
  in a civilian setting.</p>
