One of the major extras that I incorporated into this project was the comment system. On each entry blog entry users have the option to post a comment. On extension of this, in the admin panel users can edit their comments and only THEIR comments. If they are an administrator they can edit any and all comments. 

I used databases for everything and the SQL I used was definitely beyond the scope of the class.

Also, I incorporated cookies to allow the user to not have to log in more than once unless they log out from the admin panel. Log in's are good across both the admin panel and the blog admin/user preferences panel. 

There are 3 different stylesheets that the user can choose from, screenshots are shown on the preferences panel (though they are small). Mark said it would be okay to use JPG's instead of a working website. These stylesheets do not just change the color of the website, they change certain layout features as well as colors and the overall style. A little more than I think was expected. 

From the last readMe file was able to fix the SOAP part of this project and get it working. It was a case of missing quotation marks. I did ask Mark if having the location for the weather as part of the customizible and stored preferences was requred and he said it wasnt. So I didnt include it.

On a final note, I just want to ask whomever is grading this to note the subtle things. Like when you enter an invalid username it tells you that you entered an invalid username, and that there is a default user. Small things that make this project really good I feel. I tried to get rid of all the errors I possibly could, but I am unsure if I did. I went through and checked but I could have missed something.
