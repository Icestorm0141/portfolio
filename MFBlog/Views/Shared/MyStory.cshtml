<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>So you're here. And you're wondering about me. Who am I? What's my deal? Okay. I'll tell you about me.</p>
<p>My name is Anna. I'm your typical 20-something young adult. I've got friends, lots of them (in fact you may very well be one of them if you're reading this), family. I attend church in a movie theater. I work, your typical 40-50 hour a week job in front of a computer as a web developer. But none of that is what brought you here. What brought you here is this: I'm overweight. And in September 2013 I decided to change this.</p>
<p>Pretty much I've been overweight my entire life. I think the first time I can actually remember feeling overweight was somewhere around 3rd grade. There was this picture in the yearbook (yes we had year books when I was in 3rd grade), where I was surrounded by all the other kids in the library posing for a picture, and all of them were your typical cute 9 year olds. All of them except me. I was wearing this turtleneck and leggings and I had a stomach and you could see it. To this day that picture embarrasses me. </p>
<p>I could probably say that from then on I struggled with my weight, but its not completely true. I probably started being haunted by the extra pounds on my body around 6th grade. Wondering why all the other kids were in juniors size 3 and I was a juniors size 13. People always told me I was big-boned (love that cliche), and in a lot of cases it is and was completely true. I have a larger frame. I do. I will probably never be a size 0 or even a size 4. I'm okay with that. But I'm not okay being a size 20-22 and never feeling comfortable in my own skin.</p>
<p>I've always wanted to be 'skinny'. What fat person doesnt? But at the same time I've never had any interest in trying any fad diets. True, I've nibbled on a few of them. I think I did Atkins at some point in high school, and tried Weight Watchers sometime in college but I quickly grew frustrated with them and gave up. A number of years ago I decided that if I ever was going to lose the weight, I'd do it in a way that I could maintain and that worked with my life style. So for the past 2 years I've been focusing on retraining myself to go to the gym, exercise, and eat better. Here's the problem with this: This all sounds well and good until you introduce my busy schedule to the idea. So while I wanted to eat good, a good number of meals each week consisted of pasta-roni with veggies mixed in. Hey, it has veggies, that means its healthier than a burger from Wendy's right? Ya okay. Maybe. Maybe that's why I've become the queen of maintaining. Seriously. If maintaining your weight were an olympic sport I'd have 3 gold medals in it.</p>
<p>I think thats been my problem. I have always wanted to lose the weight, but at the same time I've only been giving it a half effort. Going to the gym is great but its not going to do squat for you when you're eatting pasta 2x a day. And if I'm honest, I am not sure I've really wanted to lose the weight, not badly enough. What if I fail? Gosh. What if I succeed??? Thats probably the bigger concern. I have no idea who I am without the weight. I've been fat literally my entire life. I identify with it. Its my comfort, my excuse and my reasoning. If I'm having a bad day, popcorn and wine can fix it! That boy that I'm interested in isn't paying any attention to me? Well, that must be because I'm overweight. Men don't pay attention to girls who arent skinny -- now lets go drown my sorrows in some more popcorn and wine (at least thats what my inner self says).</p>
<p>Then September comes around and my sister mentions to me that she has lost about 30lbs in 2 months and she tells me about Medifast. That caught my attention. My sister and I are very similar, except she's been actually trying to lose weight for years and years (versus me who says she's trying but really isnt). Now she's actually having success. I listen, skeptically though because as I said, I hate fad diets. But after having a few conversations with her (and now my) health coach, he talked me through how Medifast is not a fad diet and why it has worked for so many people. </p>
<p>So, with much doubt, skepticism, and fear, I took that step and said "Yes." Yes I will try this. And on September 6, 2013 I emptied my cabinets of all the carbs and cans and replaced them with 2 dozen boxes of cereal, mac & cheese, pudding, brownies and shakes and began <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Home")">my journey</a>. And that brings us to today. </p>

<h3>Today</h3>
<p>Today my life is pretty much controlled by food and the clock. On Medifast you're supposed to eat every 2-3 hours and boy does my stomach like to let me know when that 2 hour mark has hit. I was telling my friend the other day that sometimes I feel like an animal or a sea creature. I'm constantly thinking "when is my next feeding time?" However, before it was out of self indulgence. I was filling a void to make myself feel better about myself. Now those thoughts are in support of myself. I meticulously watch the clock because I'm on a journey to be healthy and part of that mean making sure I am eatting when I am supposed to.</p>
<p>The other part of this journey for me has been about learning to deal with attention. For the longest time I haven't liked being the center of attention. I'll just fade into the background while someone else gets the spotlight because I dont want people looking at me. Literally. I dont feel comfortable with people looking at me. They will then see all the curves and the bulges that I just wish didnt exist. Well not any more. I've intentionally and unintentionally started to conquer this fear. Losing weight was bound to help with that to begin with. I mean, you're the center of attention because people eventually will start to notice the difference and comment. But I did something I actually told myself I wouldnt do:</p>
<p>I went public with my weight loss.</p>
<p>I started blogging. Then I took that blog and a few weeks later I posted it to my entire Facebook world. And every week when I post an update, I post a link to it in my status as well. It hasnt gotten easy yet. It still takes courage because I'm still that fat girl that doesnt want people looking at her. But I want the accountability and I want to conquer that fear. So dilligently I post that link and share my inner most thoughts and feelings with everyone I know. Scary? Yes. Worth it? Totally. Its helping build the confidence that, come 106lbs from September 6th, I hope to have in abundance.</p>
